# NerdRx REAL WORLD HANDS-ON DEVOPS PROJECTS

 DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the systems development life cycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently, in close alignment with business objectives. The goal of DevOps is to provide a more efficient and effective way to build, deploy, and manage software applications.

 Hands-On DevOps projects aim to provide practical, real-world examples of how to implement DevOps practices using a variety of tools and technologies. These projects are designed to give developers, operations teams, and IT professionals hands-on experience with DevOps techniques, tools, and processes.

 This repository contains a list of Hands-On DevOps projects by NerdRx (Toyyib Muhammad-Jamiu also known as Abunuman) hosted on GitHub. Each project has a brief description of the project and a step-by-step documentation on how the projects was implemented.

There are 26 projects in all and an additional project on Bash Scripting for Automation while a vast majority of these projects are deployed through AWS as a CSP (Cloud Service Provider).

 This promises to be fun.
